# neighbor2neigbor for PolSAR data

# folder
`deprecated`: erroneous code, which is deprecated, but still valuable

# note
`model`: unetpp.py, 

# now
- without model summary
- without printing cfg to tensorboard
- without wrapped loss func

# TODO
- [x] rand_pool
- [x] test the PolSAR data loader
- [ ] write the N2N loss
